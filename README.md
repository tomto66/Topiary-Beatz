# Topiary Beatz 0.9.7

Topiary Beatz is a plugin for beats & drums.

* Topiary Beatz folder contains the code and a projucer file
* Topiary folder contains code used by other Topiary modules; code is duplicated to make it easy for you :)

## Compile yourself

In order to compile, you will need JUCE and the VST2 headers. Steinberg no longer provides these but you can find them in the Juce 5.3 repositories.

Careful: binary data is provided in the Topiary/JuceLibraryCode folder - make sure your projucer doesn't delete that!

## Compatibility / Testing

* Tested/Compiled with Juce 5.3 / Visual Studio 2017 / VST2 / Windows10/X64.
* Tested in Cantabile 3, Reaper and Cubase LE.
* See here for known bugs (none @ release time)  ( https://github.com/tomto66/Topiary-Beatz/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug )

## Installing binaries

* Plugin is found under Topiary Beats / binaries.  Feel free to rename it.
* Install in your VST2 plugin folder.  Your host may need to rescan that folder.
